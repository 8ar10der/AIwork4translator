Update: Cyberpet® Issues

YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND

The Next Gen of Cyberpets

by Ryder Lee, WNS News

Nostalgia is all the rage, and Biotechnica is deliv- ering it in spades. Remember the cute and loveable Cyberpets® everyone had to get their hands on back in the 2020s? Well, if you don’t, now is your chance to discover what you missed! From loveable Forever Turtle™ to cute and fluffy Datarabbit™, Biotechnica’s newest line of cyberenhanced pets has you covered when it comes to finding the best possible companion for your protection and emotional fulfillment. A true pet for life. These are not just little toys you can turn on and watch squeak about with mechanical movement but real creatures who will provide you with love and atten- tion. Once you let a Cyberpet® into your life, you’ll never return to the colorless, cold times when you were alone and bereft of their companionship.Biotechnica was nice enough to send over a Neon Newt™ for us to test out in the office.

Its bright shifting colors and ability to respond to com- mands blew us away while its secret personal defense option lit up the room. This pocket-sized flamethrower could get anyone out of a pinch! “We wanted to launch Biotechnica into the future with a classic twist,” said Biotechnica lead bioengineer Dr. Talia Vex, “What better way to jump back into bioform than by bringing the best of modern cloning and cybertechnology to the Cyberpet® process?”

Since  the  fall  of  Adrek  Robotics  during  the  4th Corporate  War,  the  former  leader  in  Cyberform models, Biotechnica has sought to fill a void in the robotics sector. And fill it they have! Not only have they revitalized their Cyberpets® line, but they have also begun rolling out bioform systems equal to or better than any security and utility drones by combining the ingenuity of human technology with the natural instincts of the animal kingdom.

We  look  forward  to  seeing  what  additional Cyberpets® Biotechnica brings to market in the near future! Currently, only eight models are available for purchase, leaving an almost infinite number of species, extinct or not, on tap to develop into new products!On a personal note, I asked Dr. Vex about the possibility of Cyberdinos, but she refused to answer. My inner child can still dream!

For more information about Biotechnica, see CP:R page 268.

CP:R refers to the Cyberpunk RED core rulebook.

Bioform_Project_Team

We have received reports of bioforms in the field acting erratic and/or showing signs of “cyberpsychotic breaks” despite our lab- oratory testing proving this is impossi- ble. While we should carefully monitor the situation, I have personally spoken to CEO Loggagia  about  the  issue,  and  he  agrees there is no need to pull our Cyberpet® line from the market. We are firmly of the opinion that any incidents are the result of misuse by the bioform’s owners and not the result of a fault in our product. Additional warning labels have been added.

Keep up the good work as we save the planet!

Dr. Talia Vex, Lead Bioengineer, Cyberpet® line

Keeping a Cyberpet

Buying a Cyberpet isn’t cheap, and keeping one isn’t cheap, either.

First, you’ve got to find one – they’re a hot commod- ity, so call a Fixer. Once you pony up the cash, you’ll need to keep your Cyberpet happy, which means buying it food, performing regular maintenance, and providing adequate space and housing.

In game terms, that means paying for your new pet’s Lifestyle (see CP:R page 377) — that’s right, you’ve gotta pay monthly for its Lifestyle in addition to  your  own.  There’s  no  cheating  this  cost.  If  you buy a Cyberrat in the middle of the month or during character generation, you’ve gotta pay for a month of full lifestyle. It is not prorated. Your pet also needs a place to sleep, and that counts toward the capacity of your Housing (see CP:R page 377). Mook-level pets do not take up much space and do not require an additional bed. Lieutenants take up one bed’s worth of space. If your new pet is a Mini-Boss it takes up two beds worth of space. For a Boss-level pet? Impressive, but that’s gonna count as 3. Also, check with your landlord. Even if they allow pets, don’t them to be chill with you keeping a bear in your apartment.

p

Training a Cyberpet

Convincing a Cyberpet to obey requires actual skill on your part. If your Animal Handling Base (INT + Animal Handling) is less than 10, the animal will not obey your commands and will act as the GM decides.

If your Animal Handling Base is 10 or higher, your Cyberpet will love you, fight alongside you, and follow your commands to the best of its ability. However, this is contingent upon its care.

If  you  haven’t  maintained  your  pet’s Lifestyle, if it hasn’t slept properly because of a lack of proper housing due to being crammed, or if you have mistreated your pet and betrayed its trust, the GM deter- mines the pet’s behavior. It can run away, refuse to obey a command, or even turn on you in a rage. If such a situation arises, the GM may allow an Animal Handling Check to regain control of the Cyberpet, but this is a temporary measure. If you don’t invest time, energy, care, and money into your pet immediately, it will go rogue again.

Cybering a Cyberpet

Implanting  more  cyber ware  into  a Cyberpet is done with the same DVs as doing so in a human, but you’re not gonna be able to go into just any hospital and find someone who can help you put a cyberarm on a rat. You’ll need to find a Medtech with Science (Biology) 4 or higher and a spe- cialized facility (as determined by the GM). Otherwise, the operation will fail and your Cyberpet won’t make it out alive.

Almost  all  cyberware  designed  for humans can be found in animal-compat- ible configurations. Animal cyberware, however, is species-specific. You can’t take cyberware from one species and install it in another without a Tech Upgrade specif- ically allowing cross-species compatibility. Even then, size matters.

YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND

No matter how much you Tech Upgrade it, a bear’s cybereye won’t fit into a rat’s eye socket.

As for if your animal can be trained to understand and use the cyberware you’re chroming them the fuck up with, doing so takes a day of training and has an Animal Handling  DV  equal  to  Installation  DV. Failure does not turn the Cyberpet against you, but the lack of adjustment means they will be unable to do more than eat and sleep until you try again and succeed.

Each Cyberpet comes with a base set of cyberware and has extra slots, allowing the owner to install additional cyberware after purchase. A Cyberpet cannot be Tech Upgraded to allow for additional slots but a Tech can Tech Upgrade one (and only one)  piece  of  cyberware  to  take  up  0 slots in a Cyberpet. Uninstalling a piece of cyberware that was part of the pet’s base set does not give them extra slots but unin- stalling cyberware that was installed after purchase does.

Fixer AvAilAbility Occasionally,  cost  in Cyberpunk RED doesn’t equate to how easy it is for a Fixer to get their paws on something.

An item or service might be pricey but easy to get or cheap but hard to get. In such cases, the cost in Eurodollars and the price category of the item can be different.

For example, purchas- ing a Forever Turtle costs 2,000eb, but GMs should treat it as Very Expensive for purposes of determining availability.

Four Cyberpet Hooks

It Came From the Sewers: Rumors of a monster under Night City have everyone on high alert.

Too Good to Be True: A shipping con- tainer, thought to be full of electronic parts, is actually holding a Cyberbear.

Head of Security: A corporate insider within Biotechnica, feeling guilty about the deaths caused by the Cyberpet+ line, reaches out for protection as she leaves the company. An assassin is trying to silence her before she can blow the lid on the whole plot.

Critter  Combat:  An  underground Cyberpet fighting ring has been uncov- ered. The gang responsible must be taken down. Caution: A dangerous number of Cyberwolves are aggressively loyal to their master, the ring leader Michele Vex.

 Cyberbear martial art As an unintended side effect of their creation, Cyberbears fight unlike any other creature on earth. While impossible to learn, duplicate, or imitate, their innate combat ability acts like a Martial Art with the following Special Moves.

Recovery Requirement: The bear is knocked prone Whenever the bear uses the Get Up Action, they can attempt to beat a DV13 with the Martial Arts Special Move Resolution. If they succeed, that Get Up Action didn’t cost an Action.

Cyberbear Three-Arm Strike Requirement: The Cyberbear hits the same target with two Bear Claw attacks this turn. Once per Turn when the bear fulfills this requirement, they can use the Martial Arts Special Move Resolution to attempt to beat a DV15. If they succeed, they may choose one of the following effects. However, should they fail, the tumor in their brain causes them to immediately suffer 5 damage directly to their HP. •  The bear can either grapple or end a grapple with their last hit  target. •  The bear can attack their last hit target again with either a Bear Claw or Combat Jaw. •  The bear can cause their target to suffer a random Body Critical Injury (see CP:R page 187). •  The bear can reduce the SP of all their last hit target’s worn armor by 4.

YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND

New Cyberware

In building the Cyberpets in this book we made use of cyberware from Black Chrome, Interface RED vol 2, Interface RED vol 3, and Micro Chrome. To make life easier, we’re reprinting any cyberware not available in the Cyberpunk RED core rulebook here. Please be aware, some of following cyberware may be changed via Tech Upgrading when used in the stat blocks of Your New Best Friend.

 X CHiPWarE COMPartMENt Cost: 100eb (Premium)•Install: Clinic

Humanity Loss: 3 (1d6)

Cybereye Option. Requires 3 Option Slots. A compartment that can conceal up to four pieces of chipware without a roll. Chipware can be easily removed as an Action by spinning the eye in its socket.

 X COMbat jaW Cost: 500eb (Expensive)•Install: Hospital

Humanity Loss: 14 (4d6)

External Body Cyberware. Requires 2 Option Slots. User’s jaw is replaced with a sizable hydraulic jaw capable of delivering devastating bite force with a two rows of reinforced teeth. The Combat Jaw functions as a Very Heavy Melee Weapon.

 X FbC CHaMELEON COatiNg Cost: 1,000eb (Very Expensive)•Install: Hospital Humanity Loss: 7 (2d6)

External  Body  Cyberware.  May  only  be installed  in  a  Full  Body  Conversion.  When the user remains still for a 1 minute (20 rounds), they can activate a cloak that hides from all visual senses, including Low Light/Infrared/UV, unless the perceiver succeeds at a DV17 Perception Check. Activating the cloak does not require an Action. The cloak is deacti- vated automatically if the user moves further than 2 m/ yds (1 square) within 3 seconds (1 Round). A second installation reduces the amount of time the user must remain still before the cloak can be activated to 30 seconds (10 Rounds). A third installation reduces the time to 9 seconds (3 Rounds). Further installations do nothing.
